  This script will help you set up your new Bridge installation.

  You will now be presented with a series of options. If you need
  any help, visit the forums at http://millertechnologies.net/forum

  You will also need a working internet connection for some stuff,
  so you should set up some type of internet (if you need wireless
  drivers, get a temporary ethernet connection if possible).

  Help is available at the Bridge Linux forums.
